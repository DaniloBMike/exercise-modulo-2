                    The history of the android mascot
                </h2>

                <p class="text-1">

                    You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most used for mobile devices worldwide. But maybe you don't know that your friendly mascot has a name and a very curious story? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.

                </p>

                <h2 class="sh2">
                    The first version
                </h2>

                <p class="text-1">

                    The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named <a id="textlink" href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank">Dan MorrillðŸ”—</a>. He says that he opened <a id="textlink" href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">InkscapeðŸ”—</a> (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of the robot. The goal was just to personify the system only for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.

                <p class="text-1">
                    This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: it would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.

                <p class="text-1">
                    The idea of having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. Russian illustrator <a id="textlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.irinablok.com/about">Irina Blok ðŸ”—</a>, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more enjoyable way.

                </picture>

                <p class="text-1">Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The drawing should also generate quick identification with those who look at it. Then came <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, Android's new mascot.</p>

                <img id="android" src="image/bugdroid.png" alt="bugdroidimage">

                <p class="text-1">The main inspiration for the new <strong>Bugdroid's</strong> features came from those little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the <strong>Google</strong> office and looked at the side of the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>
